## By both people and the will to do more

The foundation for good social influence is built together from the beginning. I believe in the inclusion of people.
– Samuel Sylf, a candidate to the parliament, the Centre.

Here are the matters, **[in Finnish](https://samuelsylf.github.io/blog/)**, through which we can work during the 2023 parliamentary election campaign. I invite you [to do.](https://forms.gle/1zbDPFrNhu2qC7gd8) Muutosvoima on yhdessä tekemistä. Kärkiteemana kannattava suunta elämälle. 


### Incentive traps out, theme 1.

We need to make diligence more worthwhile, responsibility more worthwhile, more community-friendly.

```markdown
The economic situation in Finland affects everyone; families, young people, experienced seniors.

# The cyclically-adjusted economic deficit has been on the frosty side for more than a decade.
## And growing the surplus has proved difficult.
### Over the next two parliamentary terms, the government will have to tighten _something_

- We need to make smart decisions for a prosperous tomorrow.

I'd rather...
1. **break down incentive traps**
2. **improving the attractiveness of work**
3. **enabling study and work more fairly**
...rather than tightening taxes.

### Let's do it together; one is considered around the main theme.

Let's make a return to appreciation of diligence and work. Measures not yet taken to remove incentive traps e.g. students at work, entrepreneurial activities, and small investors.
In 2021, "small-scale investing" became trend itself nationwide. Employment in Finland grew more than ever before. We may be pleased with the good news of diligence, but this is just the beginning. Structural unemployment is still 6-7%. Debt must be reduced when interest rates rise.

### Staying up to date doesn’t make a difference, but five leaps ahead do. WA-groups and social channels are different for each other. Be in touch.
Society is not a private project. The better tomorrow is made together. Choices that make us become the change.
