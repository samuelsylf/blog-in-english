## By both people and the will to do more

The foundation for good social influence is built together from the beginning. I believe in the inclusion of people.
– Samuel Sylf, a candidate to the parliament, the Centre.

Here are the matters, **[in Finnish](https://samuelsylf.github.io/blog/)**, through which we can work during the 2023 parliamentary election campaign. I invite you [to do.](https://forms.gle/1zbDPFrNhu2qC7gd8) The power of change is something we do together. The main theme is _Worthwhile Direction For Life_.


### Incentive traps out, thesis 1.

We need to make diligence more worthwhile, responsibility more worthwhile, more community-friendly.

```markdown
The economic situation in Finland affects everyone; families, young people, experienced seniors.

# The cyclically-adjusted economic deficit has been on the frosty side for more than a decade.
## And growing the surplus has proved difficult.
### Over the next two parliamentary terms, the government will have to tighten _something_

- We need to make smart decisions for a prosperous tomorrow.

I'd rather...
1. **break down incentive traps**
2. **improve the attractiveness of work**
3. **enable study and work more fairly**
...rather than tighten taxes.

### Let's do together; onenesss is considered around the main thesis.

Let's make a return to appreciation of diligence and work. Measures not yet taken to remove incentive traps e.g. students at work, entrepreneurial activities, and small investors.
In 2021, "small-scale investing" became trend itself nationwide. Employment in Finland grew more than ever before. We may be pleased with the good news of diligence, but this is just the beginning. Structural unemployment is still 6-7%. Debt must be reduced when interest rates rise.

### Staying up to date doesn’t make a difference, but five leaps ahead do. WA-groups and social channels connect up each other to the neighbourhood, where you can be active. Be in touch.
Society is not a private project. The better tomorrow is made together. Choices that foster us become the change. 
Constructively,
- Samuel Sylf
